        <h3>Reduced aid to cities &amp; towns by $90 million</h3>
        <p>According to a Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce report commissioned in March 2008, if the lottery takes a 10% hit from the introduction of casinos and slots, as it is expected to do, state lottery transferred as state aid to towns and cities will be reduced by about $90 million.</p>

        <h3>Not in my backyard.</h3>
        <p>Governor Patrick, Speaker of the House DeLeo, Senate President Murray, and Attorney General Coakley have all said they wouldn't want a casino in their hometowns.</p>
        <p>Even Steve Crosby, chairman of the Massachusetts Gaming Commission, says he wouldn't want a casino "too close" to his hometown due to "property values."</p>

        <h3>Casino jobs are among America's worst paying</h3>
        <p>The temporary increase in construction jobs to build casinos will lead to mostly low-paying casino jobs. Card dealers earn on average $15,810 per year. A family of two with that income is eligible for Food Stamps, WIC, Fuel Assistance, Utility Shutoff Protection, MassHealth, Section 8, Massachusetts Rental Voucher Program, Public Housing, and the Earned Income Credit&mdash;all at a cost to taxpayers.</p>
